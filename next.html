           <li> Hair cut is generally offered in beauty salons. Massage for the body is a beauty treatment,
             with various techniques offering benefits to the skin (including the application of beauty products) and 
              increasing mental well-being.
           </li>
        <li> Hair removal is offered at some beauty salons through treatments 
             such as waxing and threading. Some beauty salons also style hair instead of requiring clients to go 
             to a separate hair salon. Some also offer sun tanning via tanning beds.</li>
           <li> Facials may include the use of a facial maskAnother popular beauty treatment specific to the face is known as a facial. 
            The perceived effects of a facial mask treatment include revitalization, healing,
             or refreshment of the skin. They may yield temporary benefits depending on environmental,
              dietary, and other skincare factors.</li>
              <li> Although customers seek out these services for anti-aging 
              or anti-inflammatory results, there is little to no objective evidence that there are any 
              long-term benefits to the various available facial treatments.</li>
